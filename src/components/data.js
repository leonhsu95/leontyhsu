In using the application, I mocked with general wireframes to establish a base layout so that the website structure doesn't deviate as I consider colour schemes and design ideas.\n Once I coded out the website structure as template componenets in React, I worked on the backend functionalities so that I can establish a connection, server and database using Express and MongoDB amongst many other technologies. Furthermore I used Apollo Server and GraphQL to test manipulate database information so that new coffee items and users can be added. \n With core functionalities are working, I tested the backend stored data can be displayed in the front end before I proceeding with UX/UI.",

Many other designs were inspired from the hero and home pages of various websites and implementing a free stock video will attract users to the website.",

Furthermore I used Apollo Server and GraphQL to test manipulate database information so that new coffee items and users can be added. \n With core functionalities are working, I tested the backend stored data can be displayed in the front end before I proceeding with UX/UI.",
